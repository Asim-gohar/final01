Instant messaging, video calls, and real-time updates allow for constant connectivity. While this fosters a sense of global community, it also raises concerns about the quality of communication. The brevity of messages and the prevalence of emojis can lead to misunderstandings, and the speed of information dissemination sometimes outpaces fact-checking, contributing to the spread of misinformation.",

This polarization of viewpoints can lead to intensified political divisions and hinder constructive dialogue.
